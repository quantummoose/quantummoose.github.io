{% marginfigure 'mf-fig-1' 'assets/img/brainpaper.png' 'My brain, taken from a neuroimaging course.' %}

I am a [graduate student](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/muss0080) in the Cognitive and Brain Sciences program at the University of Minnesota's Psychology department.

I study computational psychology, meaning I use data science and other computational modeling tools to study human behavior through both experimental and naturalistic data. My main research interest is in understanding human motivation and decision making, most particularly human time allocation.

I also teach; I am currently an instructor for major projects (a capstone course for psychology students). Last summer I was instructor for an introduction to data analysis course for Psychology students; teaching how to perform and communicate basic statistical analysis. I've also taught research methods, previous sections of major projects, TAed various courses, and guest lectured on Bayesian cognition for undergraduates.

My other passions include game design, science communication and history, and social justice.
