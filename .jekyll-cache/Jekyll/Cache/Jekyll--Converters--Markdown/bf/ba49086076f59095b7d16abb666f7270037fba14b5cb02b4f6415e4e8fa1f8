I"4<p>My memory has been trash as of late. Actually ever since grad school I realized how limited my memory was. I was also getting older of course, and developing migraines and such. They really don’t talk about how much mental health problems (esp depression and anxiety) just can completely destroy memory and executive function.</p>

<p>But anyways, it really forced me to be more deliberate in terms of planning, notetaking, and a few other things that ended up being useful skills overall. Since I couldn’t remember anything after a meeting I had to write everything down, summarize it to everyone at the end, and even write up a short summary. Took extra time and didn’t always keep to it, but it did help.</p>

<p>The same was true of planning. I had to be really deliberate in scheduling out my days and weeks to compensate for being unable to  shift tasks. Realized I had to plan to plan, and schedule for scheduling, put in extra time just to switch tasks. I even joked with my therapist about scheduling time for existential dread<label for="b" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="b" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">It did not always work lolsob </span>.</p>

<p>One particular trick I liked was having google forms used for checklists in regular or route work. The software developers I worked with did this for QA, so when doing experimental designs we tried the same thing. Making checklists for everything is common among doctors and engineers<label for="d" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="d" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">As far as I know. There was some blog somewhere that talked about doing this in research, which I can’t find right now. </span>, since it needs to be consistent even when you’re tired and can’t think. In research checklists makes sense for a lot of things, such as making graphs or running subjects. Having this checklist be in a google form specifically means that you’ve collected all that data, and can produce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-shaping_constraint">forcing function</a> where you can force someone to answer a questions before continuing.</p>

<p>While applying this to work is obvious, using google forms for more personal things was something I hadn’t considered until my partner recently started using it. They used a google form to help work through some practices suggested by their therapist. I thought it was a great idea when they told me, so I started using it for some of my own mental health practices as well. Specifically, making a simple google form, and then saving the webpage on my phone as a quick link. Clicking it opens the form and lets me go through a bit of CBT or journaling or whatever more easily. Not a bad way to go around learning to code some wellness app.</p>
