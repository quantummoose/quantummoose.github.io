<!--- TODO write about computational psychology --->
On my webpage and google scholar (and the little business cards my lap printed for me), I call myself a "computational psychologist". To some degree this is a field I've thought should exist and want to envision myself in there, but realistically others are also in this field. But, what is it?


## Computational theory of mind.

Here it's more of a philosophical focus, or just a description of what cognitive psychology and cognitive science already are. However, the 'cognitive' part of those fields means it neglects some topics that are still considered traditionally part of psychology, such as motivation.

## Computational modeling

Here it's actually split between mathematical psychology, computational neuroscience, and computational cognitive science, or even computational social science in the broad sense.

## Data Science

Here's another way to view it; computational as more of a tool rather than a topic or approach per say.


## What am I saying about myself?

Really, it's a mix of these. I'm trying to communicate that I'm technically literate: I can program, I can develop models, and I can analyze complex data. It also tries to say more clearly my interest. The 'cognitive' often ignores phenomenon, or emphasizes an approach, that doesn't really fit with my goals. 

And as a scholar / scientist / academic, I've had a bit of soul searching on my own place in the field(s).  I don't really feel "at home" in most fields, not necessarily because I do super unique or special work, but more likely because I haven't spent the time cultivating a group at a conference or online where I can easily call people working on the topic I do my peers. My own work bounces around too much; my background is a mix of computational neuroscience, computational cognitive science, and machine learning, but the work I want to do doesn't fully fit into those fields. I feel like you were supposed to have these things figured out by the time of your dissertation, but I am possibly more confused. My current work places me in educational data mining or learning analytics as much as the previous topics, and my real research interests are often either more broad scope or humanities focused to really be in science proper.
