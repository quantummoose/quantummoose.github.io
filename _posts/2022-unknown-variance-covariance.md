variance covariance 

The problem is that many researchers don't really want to think in terms of probabilistic modeling of data. Really they don't want to think statistically, which can be hardly blamed. Some people like experimental details, or programming or math details, and others don't.

But it leads to a struggle in terms of trying to express theoretical ideas with statistical models, while skipping the whole formal modeling approach. 

In principle, there could be a good workflow of formal modeling, considering whether it explains basic phenomena, then moving to experiments and data collection. Of course a pluralistic approach is best, but I personally prefer this way of thinking.

As an aside, review?
