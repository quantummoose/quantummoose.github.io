# Let’s talk about labor problems in academia.

{% newthought "There are massive issues" %} in academia, broadly. The expansion of student debt, the reduction of resources towards teaching or research, the rise of adjuncts (75% of educators are adjuncts). The sexism and harassment that scars and pushes otherwise passionate people out of the field. I’ve personally known graduate students whose program basically lied about funding and they had to rush to get jobs to support their families. Tenure is dissolving, which is currently (besides a few graduate unions) the only form of collective action against the business interests of the academy at large.

I need to do my work, not just because I enjoy it or am passionate or it saves the world or expands human understanding, but because I have to eat and pay rent and do all the other things that make life worth living. It’s work, and work pays the bills.

# Let's talk about incentives in open science

Without pointing to particulars, a trend I’ve noticed in discussions of open science is how to change incentive structures to improve science and discourage bad science. The current state of science is (or at least appears) publish or perish, which encourages quicker, marketable, and sloppier work; there often doesn’t seem to be a career benefit to making code and data available; and some researchers seem to want to hoard knowledge or skills.

How could we change this?

There are many solutions that have been suggested. Push grant agencies and journals to only support and publish open works for example, or change hiring committees preferences. However there’s a problem I see with how this topic is discussed and framed, and that’s at the point of labor rights in research.

I want to start by mentioning that I support, and try to incorporate, open science practices {% marginfigure "1" "Especially under the broader umbrella https://twitter.com/o_guest/status/889248986984591362" %}). As I work to finish my dissertation I also want the code, data, etc to be available as well as can be, because I think it’s important to help people scaffold off of other researchers as much as possible, and provide more tools that can be broadly used. My discussion here is not about the particular practices, since I really do want people to use what’s best. There’s also the issue that the open science community (especially online and “bropen science") can be toxic, which absolutely needs to be changed (there are a lot of good and welcoming people online and in the community too!). Instead, I want to discuss the idea of “incentives” from the perspective of a motivation researcher.

My research is in motivation - in particular I’m interested in time allocation. There’s a lot of motivation research, especially in reinforcement learning, that starts from the premise of there being rewards that humans and other animals search out. There are “incentives” that people like, and people learn actions that increase their chance at getting those incentives. This is a surprisingly powerful framework that in principal seems to explain a lot of behavior. Food, especially sweet and fatty foods, is highly rewarding (or “incentivizing”), and even our more elaborate behaviors of going to work and earning income are just elaborately learned actions that result in our basic rewards.

move on to discussing intrinsic motivation - people do things without ‘extrinsic motives’

what’s the actual difference between intrinsic and extrinsic? After all, we like food because of what it does internally, and evidence suggests that we actually learn the value of food, which can change depending on other internal states (e.g., salt deprivation). There is a valuable distinction between cognitive and physiological motives, perhaps (is there even? Isn’t cognitive just physiological in the end?). But there’s something arguably simpler in terms of control.

The could all be put on to neoliberalism (or capitalism and abusive power structures if we want to go full Marx).

Truly open science.

Open science often has an implicit question: Open for who? I think many researchers want open science for honestly selfish reasons - so they can be sure and right and know what’s true. Open might actually concentrate power (think about big tech companies that others rely on). Does open include open to those from disadvantaged backgrounds? Can you do science without funding, without resources? Shouldn’t that not matter - after all, it’s just what the ideas are right? Not who has them, but if the ideas are right or wrong.

Many scientists are not full on board with democracy - the idea that everyone has a say in decisions. If truth is truth, then it shouldn’t matter who says it. But this perspective can lead to authority - once truth has been determined (by who?) then it should be followed (by whose values?). Theres a long history of science working with authoritarian governments, and

True open science must also work on labor rights. It must decolonize - if people in the global south can’t do science than science is not open. It must ...

When we talk incentives we’re talking politics. We have to be aware of the history of science, and how it’s interacted with marginalized, with power structures, and with policy. We need to understand media and communication. Work with other fields - humanities.


Science is a job - a profession. It’s a subset of empiricism - a way of learning from the world. It is a way of constructing knowledge.
