{% newthought "Safety and threat" %} are interesting things in video games. In horror games this is something the designer explicitly plays with, trying to [spook you with their spooky spooks](https://youtu.be/vQN4UHM_PoU?t=4m40s). But these feelings of fear and calm occur in most games. They seem to occur in any game where there are threats that have to be *avoided*, which produces relief when successful. What's interesting is how these feelings adapt based on your [expectations of survival and threat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4364301/) in these games.

In the *Dark Souls* series the bonfire acts as a "save state" for your character, filling up your health and resources and providing a respawn point for the next time you die{% sidenote "one" "[and you will die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYbOVTQnbAA)" %}. They often are placed just after dense areas populated by monsters, and once you get there and light the fire you have an instant feeling of relief.

Most games generally have the difficulty of a game fluctuate up and down, sustaining periods of high intensity followed by periods of soothing calm. Usually these periods of safety are strongly signaled by some *cue* in the environment. These cues have to be consistent, so that when you are in the safe zone you know you won't be attacked or threatened in any way. If the cues are inconsistent then they can't be trusted, and no consistent feeling of safety occurs since you can't track how well you're avoiding threats.

In *Left 4 Dead* these safe spots are literally termed "safe houses", and provides complete safety from zombies (the main threat in the game). These houses are locked rooms enclosed and encased in concrete, which provides clear prior cues to safety. These safe rooms are the safest parts of the game (besides the ending rescue) and provide extra ammunition, weapons, and health. They also provide little moments for the characters to interact.

The threat fluctuates outside of the safe room as well. The graph below shows the measured game intensity based on zombie population. The threat of zombies here fluctuates explicitly based on the AI director, which tracks the intensity of the game and adaptively controls it. When the intensity gets too high it pulls back and spawns less zombies, but in periods of calm it ramps up and starts to spawn more and more. Most games do the same thing, but usually just based on enemy placement when a level is designed.

Games can play with these feelings of safety and mess with your expectations one way or the other. In the game [*Amnesia: The Dark Descent*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jWsiyXoTz0) you are tracked by a few unknown monsters throughout most of the game, and can hide in the dark at the risk of insanity. Light is a common safety motif across games, mostly due to the simple fact that light allows for sight. However some play with this; in Amnesia there's a tradeoff, while in [*Among the Sleep*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_the_Sleep) light is a limited resource.

Throughout most of Amnesia the game presents a fairly constant (though still fluctuating) state of fear. However a few moments of relative safety do occur, one being the presence of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa.

{% maincolumn "assets/img/safety_games/amnesia-the-dark-descent-agrippa.jpg" "<a href='https://youtu.be/syBkLLe-_nk?t=4m33s'>Hey buddy</a>" %}

Despite the way he looks, Agrippa becomes your best friend by the time you get to him. Later you have to saw off his head and shove it into your knapsack, which he very appreciates. At this point in the game you're on constant alert; scared of your own shadow. So having the first person you meet in the game so calmly talk to you, without any fear in a fairly brightly lit room, gives you a wonderful sense of relief. If Agrippa were the first thing you saw in the game I'm sure your feelings towards him would be widely different.

I think these feelings of threat and safety are really important to most games. It's interesting to think about what cues people learn or assume signal safety. It's also interesting to think about the rhythms that people enjoy the most. If the game is too constantly at a high intensity it can quickly become overwhelming, but in some games the high intensity is really desired. The same [emotional rhythms](http://hedonometer.org/books/v3/1777/) occur in movies and books too, suggesting they are generally important to engagement in a story.

The best writers, directors, and designers have an intuitive knack for when a story should be high or low. It's likely a whole mess of factors, including cognitive fatigue along with motivational and perceptual expectations. I'm curious what deeper principles lie behind these rhythms and our sense of safety.
