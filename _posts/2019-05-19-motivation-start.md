# A series

{% newthought "I have a problem" %} with my own motivation in terms of writing for my blog. Part of it is my own mental health -- I've struggled with anxiety and depression for quite a while, and the intense focus on work in academia doesn't mesh well with that. Part of it is how I view my own time -- time spent on "productive" things is better, but it takes more out of me. Something I've slowly realized about my time in academia is that it's a job, which seems obvious but takes time for the implications to sink in.

Part of an academic's job is outreach. I have spent a _lot_ of time reading and learning and doing motivation research and theory, most of which won't come out in most of my standard work. I want to spend some of my Work Time (and that's capital WT, 40 hours a week, I stop when I'm done Work Time) writing about it. So, this is part of my writing, which will hopefully expand to a series, on motivation.

# Motivation

"Motivation", as a term, is unfortunately overloaded even within an individual field like psychology. Partly that's due to the ever-fracturing nature of "psychology" itself as a research field. Motivation refers to a phenomenon to be researched, a subjective experience, an intervention targeted through self-help, and a set of mechanisms used to explain behavior.

The most broad notion of "motivation" is understanding the causes of human behavior.

Motivation as mechanisms

Motivation as individual experience and self-help

Motivation as phenomenon
