Measurement requiring theory, and a question. Measures are often made without regards to either, and the quantification of "good" measures in psychometrics are often separate from the rest of the work. 

Simple measurement example? Binary separation from 

For example, a standard statistic used to determine the quality of a measure is [Chronbach's alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha). 

-- simple summary --

Much like Cohan's d metric, or other simple statistics used throughout psychometrics or signal-detection theory, the usefulness of this equation draws particularly on the idea of _what model you assume_ for the data. Even though it draws from the sampling distribution, and so is arguably an attempt at being general, it still embeds assumptions that could be gotten around by good use of modeling.

What would good modeling be? Consider a probabilistic modeling approach, i.e., a Bayesian workflow (betaalpha). In that case, what would we consider?

-- modeling something --

So what's the difference between modeling and measurement? They're part of the same process and consideration, same as a data model. They all depend on the theoretical assumptions we have concerning the observation process of the phenomena. 

However, there's Often thought of in a non-theory way. As preprocessing (tweet made me think of it?). 

-- Consider, for example, heart rate. --

The question under consideration could be blah, so in that sense we consider that the particular theory concerning this question is independent from those concerning the observation. That is, the measurement is easy to decompose from other modeling, and we can recombine them later without concern. This isn't always the case.

-- how relevant is this topic? --

A related idea in control theory is the [separation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_principle), that is the idea that control and estimation can (in some instances) be decomposed. If the separation principle holds for a given control problem, then the inference problem (figuring out "what is there") and the decision problem (figuring out "what to do") can be solved independently. This doesn't always hold of course, and importantly...

?? Anything else ?? This could be enough
